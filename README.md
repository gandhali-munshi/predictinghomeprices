# Projected Foreclosures in the Oklahoma County Region
# Summary
  Our team presented list of properties in Oklahoma County that are expected to be listed for sale on the market soon. Property investors usually must invest in properties that are currently listed on the market which can make their investment process quick, since properties are typically sold shortly after being posted. We are presenting data that would allow for property investors to view properties that have a high chance of being listed for sale on the market. This would give the property investors an idea and more time to decide if a specific property is worth their investment. This project will benefit property investors and their time as well as sellers, as their property could be sold the same day it was listed.
